# Net-Banking-System
This repository consists of all things associated with the project of making a toy net banking system. This project is created as a part of my B. Tech. Mini Project at [DAIICT, Gandhinagar](https://www.daiict.ac.in/) under [Professor P. M. Jat](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/p-m-jat/).

## About the project
This project was done to better understand Spring[, Spring MVC] and Hibernate frameworks. Following is the abstract for the project as submitted in the Mini Project Request form:

**Abstract**  
The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. It also works as an inversion of control container for Java and has support for Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which lets us create application-wide services by modularizing cross-cutting concerns in aspects. The goal of this project is to produce a working prototype that is built by using the Spring Framework that can be used as a teaching aid. Proper documentation will be provided alongside the prototype providing insight into the internal flow respectively taken care by the framework components. This project is a part of the general Spring Framework Educational Aid for Enterprise Development and it will cover the Client-Side Presentations and Server-Side Presentation parts. The other sub-project will cover Server-Side Business Logic and Database interactions. Spring uses a Spring-MVC framework internally which is used to build web-applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. This project will be web-based and make use of the Spring MVC framework. Additionally, this project will make use of Log4j which is a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java, which is distributed under the Apache Software License.

**Software Development Process**: This project will follow the Agile methodology. The reason for selecting this particular methodology is that only core requirements and details about the project are known. However, since all the technology that is going to be used is new to the developers, the details of coding are uncertain. To get introduced to the Agile methodology [click here](https://angel.co/blog/agile-methodology-a-primer-on-moving-fast).

**Implementation**: [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2HoZpFJjwLFG1GDQKb-hVswMM-KdguSPz5yKVRMY0E/edit?usp=sharing) is an in-progress document like an SRS but has no particular structure defined as of now. This will change in later revisions.
